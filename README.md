#To whom it may concern

I  understand the brief of the exercise however I have come to realise that building that nested data structure would necessitate more than an hour's work and I have made a head start of the main branch which is incomplete, however I have also built a solution that works and delivers the required resources using Terraform but with a model that is simpler, this is what I can deliver quickly. To be honest I probably could use a bit of pair programming for the required nested data structure.

#working-solution branch
Please checkout the branch: working-solution  -> for a full working solution - the working hard version :)

In working-solution there are 3 terraform workspaces, once for each environment: test, staging, production.
